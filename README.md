Title: Chubby's Steakhouse


Description:
  Our project will be a 3D game where you will play as an employee of a restaurant named Chubby's Steakhouse. The player will act as a server mainly and must complete the following tasks at a quick pace in order to make customers happy. Player must greet table, take drink orders, pick up and serve drinks, take food order (which will vary based on difficulty setting but will consist mainly of a steak the temperature of the steak and perhaps a side item or salad), put the order into a system by memory by going to a computer then inputting various buttons that relate to the order such as in a real restaurant, deliver food, take care of issues dealing with food. If a customer gets too upset the table will leave and you will lose points.

Vision Statement:
  "Create a fun yet challenging game that gives some insight into what a real server goes through."

Motivation:
  Most of us have had the dream of creating a video game. Now this is our opportunity to do so. We are excited to learn about new tools and techniques for game design.

Risks:  
  -workload conflicts from other classes   
  -Not very creative when it comes to designing levels and game assets  
  -new material being used (i.e. trello, unity)   
  -schedule conflicts for in-person meetings  
  
 Mitigation strategy:
  We will be able to use a wide variety of resources to help us with our inexperience with the Unity 5 game engine. We also have made a group chat so we can plan ahead for meetings and find times where we can all work on the project. By creating the project plan, we can also see when we want to have every piece of the project finished. In terms of creativity, we can draw inspiration from what others may have done in the past.
  
User Stories:   
  US1: As a player, I want an enjoyable game.   
  US2: As a player, I want to have a game that is easy to learn.    
  US3: As a player, I want to have varying game difficulty to test myself.  
  US4: As a player, I want to have different game modes or characters.  
  US5: As a customer, I want to have replayability in my game.  
  US6: As a developer, I want to produce a fast, bug free game. 

Methodology: Which methodology you plan to follow, though it may change: Waterfall, iterfall, Agile, mash-up of â€¦ 

Project Tracking software: We will be using trello.
