Part 1 - Proposal, repository, project tracker, requirements
Due date
February 16, 2017 at 6:00 pm

A huge part of software development goes into planning, whether planning up front as in Waterfall or planning every sprint in Agile. Planning consists of the requirements for a project and project tracking software to keep track as you go (among other things).

You may opt for a Waterfall or Agile (or mash-up) approach for the project (you can change your methodology during the project as you wish).

Create a group GitHub repository and ensure all group members are collaborators.
Add your team information to a README.md file in the repository’s root directory. This is a text file written in Markdown format. No DOCX or PDF files, must be plain text.
You need to submit the URL to your repository that contains a README.md file with the following information:

Who: List of people on the team: Full names and GitHub user names
Title: Title of the project
Description: Short description of the project (help explain to us what you are doing)
Vision statement: (what you would tell potential customers) Be sure to follow the guidelines from lecture!
Motivation: for working on this particular project (Why would you develop this?)
Risks: to project completion (these could include:
Working environment or language new to some team members,
No prior experience working with the people on the team,
Lack of availability of some needed resource, etc.)
Mitigation strategy for dealing with the risk
List of requirements: for the project
6 user stories
Each story must have a unique ID number
Written in the Agile format: “As a [role], I want to [do X] so that I can [benefit with Y]”
Each requirement must have a size. You have two options for sizing:
Agile sizing – story points
Time estimate to complete
All stories should be sized to be completed in less than 8 hours (approximately, and something equivalent to a day or less in Agile story points). If your story is bigger than that, then break it up into smaller stories.

[optional] you can add priority (Critical, High, Med, Low, Nice-to-have)
[optional] you can add topic/area (e.g., Login, Profile, DB, etc.)
[optional] you can add user type (e.g., Admin, end user, potential customer,…)
Methodology: Which methodology you plan to follow, though it may change: Waterfall, iterfall, Agile, mash-up of …
Project Tracking software:
Name of the software you will use
Trello is most common
Pivotal Tracker
Basecamp
GitHub Issues & Milestones
Link to project tracking software: make sure instructor and TAs have access
Be sure to continue to use this throughout the semester! Even though these are small projects, the point is to practice the methodologies and tools used in industry!
Project plan: created from your Project Tracking software. Copy-paste the plan (or screenshot of) from your project tracking software into the repository.
