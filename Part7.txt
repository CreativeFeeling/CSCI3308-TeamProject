Part 7 - Peer Evaluation & Project Reflection

Due date

May 4, 2017 at 6:00 pm

This portion of the project must be completed individually. The first part is to fill out an evaluation of your peers on the project. The second part is to answer a common potential interview question about working in teams. All members of the group must submit individually to Moodle

Submit the peer evaluation as a spreadsheet (not a pdf) as Lastname_Firstname.xls
Note: putting all the same # in everything or per person or the like does not count as filling out a peer evaluation and will receive a zero.
Be sure to fill out the explanation of the peer evaluation on how your team did overall or issues with your fellow team members.
In the spreadsheet, write a short paragraph answering one of these following potential interview questions based on your experiences this semester on the team project.

Grading will be based on the quality of your answer and how well you handle team dynamics. Be honest. An interviewer can always tell if you are being genuine. The goal of this exercise is to prep you for interviewing.

Give an example of when you worked in a team and there was conflict or disagreement. How did you handle it? Did you reach a consensus? What would you do differently next time?
Give an example of when you worked in a team and one member always dominated the meetings and discussions. What did you do to help the rest of the team become more involved? What would you do differently next time?
Give an example of when you worked in a team and one member refused to do any work. How did you handle the situation? What would you do differently next time?
